In 1972, David Parnas  introduced concept of Modularization  on the 
principle of decomposing a large, complex software system into “Loosely 
coupled, highly cohesive”

Microservices Architecure  is a software development technique  which arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled,  highly cohesive services.
 The term, “loosely coupled” means the dependency between modules should be very low and “highly cohesive” means that one module should focus on single or similar functionality.
